## Cormorant PSMC Pipeline Overview (Do we wanna include Outputs too? under each section)

#Step 1: Quality Control
-**Tool** [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
-**Purpose** Assess read quality, GC content, and adapter contamination.
-**Code**

#Step 2: Read Trimming
-**Tool** [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)
-**Purpose** Remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences
-**Code**

#Step 3: Read Mapping
-**Tool**[BWA-MEM](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
-**Reference Genome** *Phalacrocorax carbo* (NCBI accession: GCA_963921805.1)  (Do we wanna do others as well?)
-**Purpose** Align clean reads to the reference genome.
-**Code**

#Step 4: Post-Alignment Processing
-**Tool** [SAMtools](http://www.htslib.org/)
-**Purpose** Sort, index, and filter aligned reads.
-**Code**

#Step 5: Variant Calling and FASTA Conversion
-**Tool** [BCFtools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/)
-**Purpose** Generate consensus diploid FASTA files compatible with PSMC.
-**Code**

#Step 6: Demographic Inference/PSMC
-**Tool** [PSMC](https://github.com/lh3/psmc)
-**Purpose** Infer changes in effective population size (*Ne*) over time.
-**Code**

##Acknowledgements
I want to thank **Fabiola León**, **Francisco Pinilla Riquelme**, and **Paulo Simón Zepeda Godoy** for their guidance and feedback throughout the development of this pipeline. Their insight was invaluable in refining the code and ensuring the reproducibility of each step.
